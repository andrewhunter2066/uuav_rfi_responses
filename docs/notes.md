## Question
What is the best way to collate responses to a requirements request for information. Think deeply

### Initial Response

Great question — collating responses to a requirements request for information (RFI / RfI) is where good 
procurement/product decisions get made or broken. The single best principle to follow is: make responses directly 
comparable, auditable, and traceable. Below I’ll give a practical, end-to-end method (process + templates + scoring + 
tooling + governance) you can use immediately.

#### Quick summary (one-line)

Require a structured submission, validate & normalise each response into a single primary register, map every answer to 
requirement IDs, evaluate with a weighted rubric by SMEs (blind where possible), and keep an auditable trail of 
evidence and decisions.

---

#### 1) Design Upfront — reduce the pain later

- Issue a **structured response template** (machine-friendly if possible — CSV/Excel/JSON or form). Ask vendors to 
answer by requirement ID, not free text blobs.
- Define **mandatory fields** (company, contact, submission timestamp, requirement_id, response_text, 
evidence_reference, compliance: Y/N, assumptions, commercial notes, attachments).
- Publish **evaluation criteria** and weights in the RFI so respondents know how they’ll be judged.
- Set clear **deadlines, Q&A windows, confidentiality rules**, and a single method for submission (e.g. secure portal, 
signed SFTP, or email to a monitored inbox).

---

#### 2) Intake & validation (first 24–48 hours after receipt)

- Give every incoming response a **unique submission ID** and store originals untouched (ZIP the original package).
- Run a **completeness check**:
  - Are all mandatory fields present?
  - Are attachments present and readable?
  - Is submission on time?
  - If incomplete, log it and follow your published policy (reject, accept-with-qualification, or allow remedy).
- Record meta-data: timestamp, filename, submitter email, method of delivery, who performed intake.

---

#### 3) Normalise & extract into a primary register

Create a single “master register” (spreadsheet or database). This is your single source of truth.

Suggested spreadsheet headers (example):

| SubmissionID | VendorName | Contact | SubmittedOn | RequirementID | RequirementText | VendorResponseSummary | FullResponseLink | Compliance(Y/N) | EvidenceLink(s) | Assumptions | Score_Provision | Score_Risk | Score_Cost | Notes | ReviewerAssigned |
|--------------|------------|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|------------|-------|------------------|
| 1            | Acme       |         | 2021-01-01  | 1             | This is a test  | This is a test        | https://acme.com | Y               |                 |             | 0.5             | 0.5        | 0.5        |       |                  |

- For each requirement, create one row per vendor so comparisons are row-aligned by <code>RequirementID</code>.
- If vendors used different units/terminology, normalise units and capture the original in an evidence column.
- Summarise long answers into a 1–2 sentence VendorResponseSummary for quick scanning.

---

#### 4) Map responses to requirements and classify

- Add columns for **requirement type** (Must / Should / Nice-to-have), system area, and risk impact.
- Add a <code>TraceToRequirement</code> column linking to your primary requirements document (ReqID → ReqText).
- Flag any **non-conformances** or exceptions in a <code>Compliance</code> column.

---

#### 5) Scoring, weighting, and blind review

- Use a **numeric rubric** (0–5 or 0–10) for each criterion and predefined weights.
- Example criteria set (weights shown):
  - Functional fit — weight 0.40
  - Technical viability / integrations — weight 0.25
  - Commercial / TCO — weight 0.20
  - Risk & compliance — weight 0.10
  - Support & delivery — weight 0.05

Scoring formula:

$$
WeightedScore = sum(score_i * weight_i) / sum(weights)
$$

Short numeric example (calculate digit-by-digit):

- Vendor scores: Functional 4, Technical 3, Commercial 5; weights 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 respectively.
  - 4 * 0.5 = 2.0
  - 3 * 0.3 = 0.9
  - 5 * 0.2 = 1.0
  - Total = 2.0 + 0.9 + 1.0 = 3.9 (weighted score)

- Score blind where possible: have reviewers score on the substance before seeing vendor identity to reduce bias.
- Use at least two independent reviewers per requirement or cluster; reconcile major disagreements in a short 
calibration meeting.

---

#### 6) Shortlist, verify evidence, and follow-up

- Shortlist by weighted score thresholds (e.g. top N or > X score).
- For shortlisted vendors, **verify evidence** (references, demos, PoCs, sample data).
- Run targeted clarification rounds: publish clarified Q&A publicly to all vendors if the RFI process allows.

---

#### 7) Governance & audit trail

- Keep an **audit log** of who changed scores/notes and when.
- Retain original submissions and all correspondence in a secure archive.
- Track conflicts of interest and reviewer assignments.
- Capture a **decision rationale** document for procurement/compliance audits.

---

#### 8) Tooling suggestions by scale

- Small (3–10 vendors): Google Sheets/Excel + folder on SharePoint/Drive; use consistent naming conventions.
- Medium (10–50 vendors): Airtable / Smartsheet / Coda — better for views, attachments, lightweight automation.
- Large / regulated: RFP/RFI platform or eProcurement solution (Jaggaer, Coupa, etc.) or built workflows in 
ServiceNow/Ariba.
- For traceability to engineering/product requirements: link the primary register to JIRA/Asana/Confluence using 
requirement IDs.
- Automation ideas: parse attachments with OCR (for scanned PDFs), use simple NLP to extract claims, or write scripts 
that transform vendor Excel/CSV into your schema.

---

#### 9) Handling qualitative answers & different formats

- Require an **Executive Summary** in every response (one paragraph stating core capability and limitations).
- For long technical essays, extract 3–5 **evidence statements** and link the page/paragraph in 
<code>EvidenceLink</code>.
- If vendors provide proprietary docs, ask for a short public summary you can share internally and a private detailed 
document for review.

---

#### 10) Legal, security, and sensitive data

- Ensure NDAs / IP terms are handled up front.
- Don’t accept sensitive production data from vendors unless governed by a data handling agreement.
- Maintain redaction guidelines for attachments if you will share responses widely.

---

#### 11) Quick checklist to run right now

1. Publish structured response template + evaluation weights.
2. Set up primary register spreadsheet and folder structure.
3. Assign intake owner, SME reviewers, evaluation chair.
4. When responses arrive: assign SubmissionID, validate completeness, upload originals.
5. Normalise responses into primary register, assign reviewer(s).
6. Score blind, reconcile, shortlist, verify evidence, and record final rationale.

---

#### 12) Example email snippets (copy/paste)

##### Acknowledge receipt

Subject: RFI Submission Received — [RFI Title] — [Vendor]
Thanks — we received your submission on [date]. Submission ID: [ID]. We will validate completeness and contact you if 
clarifications are required. Deadline for Q&A: [date].

##### Request clarification

Subject: RFI Clarification Needed — [RFI Title] — [Vendor]
Please provide a short answer to Requirement [ReqID]: [exact question]. Attach any supporting documentation. Please 
respond by [date]. Your submission remains under review.

---

#### Final tips / pitfall avoidance

- **Don’t accept free-form answers** unless you’re ready to pay the heavy normalisation cost. Structured templates save 
hours.
- **Be explicit about assumptions** and scoring rules up front (avoids vendor gaming).
- Use a **single source of truth** (master register) — don’t let dozens of disconnected comment documents proliferate.
- Keep the review process **timely and transparent** to vendors (keeps them engaged and reduces rework).

## Refining Question

How would the process change if the RFI was to illicit requirements for a software application from subject matter 
experts?

### Answer

Excellent — that’s a subtle but crucial shift.

When your RFI is aimed at eliciting requirements (from internal or external subject matter experts), not evaluating 
vendor responses, the goal is discovery, synthesis, and consensus-building — not compliance comparison.

Let’s think deeply through how this changes everything.

---
### Core Purpose Shift
| Traditional RFI              | Requirements-Elicitation RFI                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Collects offers from vendors | Gathers expert knowledge, needs, constraints |
| Compares solutions           | Synthesizes requirements                     |
| Focus on fairness & scoring  | Focus on clarity & consensus                 |
| Ends with shortlist          | Ends with a requirements baseline or backlog |

So instead of *collating for evaluation*, you’re *curating for understanding*.
Your process should resemble a **research and analysis workflow** rather than a procurement one.

---

#### 1. Reframe the RFI structure

Instead of “Please confirm compliance with requirement X,” you ask “What should this application enable, constrain, or 
integrate with?”

You design your RFI like a **structured conversation guide**, not a compliance table.

**Typical sections**:

1. Context / objectives (why we’re building the application)
2. Domains or user groups (who it’s for)
3. Current pain points or process descriptions
4. Key functionality questions (what do you need the system to do?)
5. Data requirements
6. Integration touchpoints
7. Security, compliance, governance
8. Reporting, analytics, and KPIs
9. Future growth / scalability / “what’s missing today”

Each section invites structured responses but allows elaboration.

---

#### 2. Intake & response format

You still want structured responses — but semantic, not binary.

**Template example**:

| Section | Question ID | Question Text | SME Name | Role | Response Summary | Priority (H/M/L) | Example or Evidence | Dependencies | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| 1       | 1           | Context       |          |      |                  |                  |                     |              |       |

- Let SMEs submit via:
  - A **form or spreadsheet** (for smaller groups)
  - A **collaborative requirements capture tool** (like Notion, Confluence, Airtable, or Jira Discovery)
  - Or **facilitated workshops recorded into this schema**

---

#### 3. Collation → becomes synthesis

Instead of normalising numeric scores, your job becomes **pattern recognition**.

**Steps:**
1. **Categorise** all responses under high-level requirement themes (functional, non-functional, data, interface, 
regulatory, etc.).
2. **Cluster similar statements** using keyword tagging or manual affinity mapping.
  - e.g. “system should send notifications” and “must email users on update” → cluster under “Notifications.”
3. **Identify conflicts or duplicates** (“export must be Excel-only” vs. “export must support CSV/JSON”).
4. **Extract ‘atomic’ requirement statements** — each describing one capability or constraint.
5. **Prioritise** (via MoSCoW, Kano, or Weighted Shortest Job First).

This is analytical rather than administrative.

---

#### 4. Validation & consensus round

After synthesis, issue a *Requirements Summary Pack** back to SMEs for validation.

Include:

- Proposed categories and requirement wording
- Duplicates merged
- Traceability back to SME input
- Draft prioritization

Ask them to:

- Confirm accuracy (“does this reflect your need?”)
- Flag gaps or misinterpretations
- Re-rank priorities if needed

This is the **collation review loop**, equivalent to your “evaluation stage” in a procurement RFI.

---

#### 5. Output — the Requirements Baseline

Final product is not a scorecard but a **structured, traceable requirements document**.

Recommended structure:

| ReqID | Category   | Requirement Statement            | Source SME(s) | Rationale | Priority | Acceptance Criteria | Dependencies | Related ReqIDs | Notes |
|-------|------------|----------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| 1     | Functional | System should send notifications |               |           | H        | Must send email     |              |                |       |

Optionally tag:

- Functional / Non-functional
- Business / System / Data / Integration / UX / Security
- User story style: “As a [user], I need [requirement] so that [value].”

---

#### 6. Tooling options (depending on scale)

| Scale                            | Recommended Tools                           | Why                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Small (<10 SMEs)                 | Excel/Google Sheets + pivot tables          | Simple, transparent                  |
| Medium (10–30 SMEs)              | Airtable, Notion, or Confluence             | Collaboration, tagging, synthesis    |
| Large (>30 SMEs or multi-region) | ReqView, Jira Discovery, IBM DOORS, or Jama | Traceability, baselining, versioning |

**Pro tip**: Tag every SME statement with a *unique source ID* so you can trace how it transformed into a requirement. 
That builds legitimacy.

---

#### 7. Optional automation aids

If you receive free-form documents or emails:

- Use **text clustering / NLP** (e.g. ChatGPT, spaCy, or GPT-based embeddings) to group similar requirements.
- Generate candidate requirement statements automatically, then review them manually.
- Use **topic modelling** to identify emergent themes from qualitative data.

---

#### 8. Governance, roles, and quality control

| Role                     | Responsibility                                       |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements facilitator | Designs RFI, moderates responses, performs synthesis |
| SME                      | Provides domain input                                |
| Business analyst         | Refines, validates, structures                       |
| Architect                | Assesses feasibility                                 |
| Product owner / sponsor  | Prioritizes and approves baseline                    |

Establish a **decision record**: if two SMEs disagree, log the rationale behind chosen wording.

#### 9. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

| Pitfall                                     | How to avoid                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SMEs answer at different abstraction levels | Provide examples of desired detail (“System shall allow user to X” vs “Make it easy to use”). |
| Conflicting requirements                    | Use dependency mapping and conflict tagging.                                                  |
| Overwhelming detail early                   | Stage the elicitation: business → functional → technical.                                     |
| Losing SME buy-in                           | Keep them in the loop — show how their input shaped the baseline.                             |
| No clear decision authority                 | Assign a requirements owner early.                                                            |

#### 10. Comparison summary — procurement vs. elicitation RFIs

| Dimension       | Procurement RFI        | Requirements-Elicitation RFI         |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Goal            | Compare vendors        | Capture needs                        |
| Inputs          | Vendor capabilities    | SME knowledge                        |
| Output          | Vendor shortlist       | Requirements baseline                |
| Scoring         | Quantitative           | Qualitative / priority-based         |
| Collation       | Compliance matrix      | Synthesis map / affinity groups      |
| Evaluation      | Weighted scoring       | Consensus review                     |
| Tools           | eProcurement, Excel    | Requirements tools, Confluence, Jira |
| Success measure | Fairness, completeness | Clarity, consensus, traceability     |

---

#### 11. Deliverables to expect

At the end of a good elicitation RFI, you should have:

1. **Master Requirements Register** (with IDs, priorities, rationales)
2. **SME Traceability Map**
3. **Summary Report** (themes, conflicts, gaps)
4. **Validated Baseline v1.0**
5. Optional: **User Stories Backlog** (for import into Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)

## Follow-on Question
The software application is a web-based internal business system. The SMEs are operations stall, data analysts, 
managers, and end users. Initial responses will be via spreadsheets which will be followed up via workshops and 
hopefully email interviews. The preferred format is CSV for use in GitHub and ultimately a knowledge graph. The 
addition of prioritisation logic would be helpful.

### Response

You’re essentially building a requirements knowledge graph grounded in structured SME elicitation, which means the CSV 
schema should be:

- *human-readable*,
- *machine-ingestible*, and
- *traceable over revisions* (perfect for GitHub).

Below is the **recommended CSV structure**, followed by field explanations, workflow, and optional prioritisation logic 
you can embed or compute automatically.

#### RFI Requirements Elicitation Template (CSV Schema)

Each row = *one requirement statement* (or SME comment that can become one).

|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RequirementID**        | `REQ-001`, `REQ-002`                                         | Unique ID for traceability (Git commit or auto-numbered).      |
| **Section**              | e.g., “User Management”, “Reporting”, “Integrations”         | Used for grouping and filtering.                               |
| **Theme**                | `Functional`, `NonFunctional`, `Data`, `Security`, `UX`      | Helps knowledge graph categorization.                          |
| **SMEName**              | “Jane Doe”                                                   | Identifies source; later pseudonymize if needed.               |
| **SMERole**              | “Data Analyst”, “Manager”                                    | Useful for weighting responses (e.g., business vs. technical). |

| **RequirementStatement** | “System must allow bulk upload of CSV data.”                 | Canonical, atomic requirement phrased clearly.                 |
| **ProblemStatement**     | “Manual uploads are time-consuming and error-prone.”         | Root cause; supports context.                                  |
| **ProposedSolution**     | “Automated upload with field mapping validation.”            | Optional; records SME’s idea, not final design.                |
| **Priority**             | `Must`, `Should`, `Could`, `Won’t`                           | MoSCoW-style priority.                                         |
| **Importance**           | `1–5`                                                        | How critical SME feels it is.                                  |
| **Frequency**            | `1–5`                                                        | How often this requirement impacts their work.                 |
| **Feasibility**          | `1–5`                                                        | (later filled by architects/product team).                     |
| **Dependencies**         | e.g., “REQ-017”, “API availability”                          | Enables network graph of dependencies.                         |
| **RelatedIDs**           | e.g., “REQ-002, REQ-006”                                     | Links overlapping or duplicate ideas.                          |
| **Rationale**            | “Supports automation goal in project charter.”               | Why the requirement matters.                                   |
| **AcceptanceCriteria**   | “User can upload files up to 10MB; invalid rows are logged.” | Definition of done.                                            |
| **Assumptions**          | “Users have pre-cleaned data.”                               | Contextual assumptions.                                        |
| **Conflicts**            | “REQ-012 limits upload types.”                               | Mark potential contradictions.                                 |
| **Status**               | `Draft`, `Validated`, `Merged`, `Rejected`                   | Used during synthesis & validation.                            |
| **FollowUpNeeded**       | `Yes/No`                                                     | Flag for workshop discussion.                                  |
| **WorkshopNotes**        | “Reviewed on 2025-10-20, agreed to merge with REQ-007.”      | Captures decisions.                                            |

#### Embedded Prioritisation Logic

If you want to calculate a *computed priority score* for synthesis and ranking, you can include a derived field (e.g. in 
an analysis script or a formula during collation):

**Formula:**
$$
PriorityScore = (Importance * 0.4) + (Frequency * 0.3) + (Feasibility * 0.3)
$$

Or, if you want to explicitly favour SME impact:

$$
PriorityScore = (Importance * 0.5) + (Frequency * 0.4) + (Feasibility * 0.1)
$$

You can then rank requirements descending by <code>PriorityScore</code> for workshop review.

Add a column if you like:

<code>PriorityScore</code>

#### Recommended Workflow

1. **Distribute the CSV template** to SMEs with simple guidance:
  - Each row = one need or issue.
  - Fill only columns relevant to your input; leave blank if unsure.
  - Use one file per SME (simplifies attribution in Git).
2. **Collect and commit** each SME’s CSV to a GitHub repo (e.g. <code>/input/sme-name.csv</code>).
3. **Collate automatically** (e.g. Python/Pandas or GitHub Actions workflow) into 
<code>/derived/master_requirements.csv</code>.
4. **Run normalisation & deduplication**, generate priority scores, and output graphs (e.g. Neo4j, RDF, or JSON-LD).
5. **During workshops**:
  - Tag “FollowUpNeeded = Yes” rows for live discussion.
  - Update Status, merge duplicates, and record WorkshopNotes.
6. After validation, publish a <code>/baseline/requirements_v1.0.csv</code> for downstream development or modelling.

#### Knowledge Graph Alignment (forward-thinking)

Each row naturally becomes a node in your graph:
- <code>RequirementID</code> → Node ID
- <code>SMEName</code>, <code>SMERole</code> → connected via <code>PROVIDED_BY</code>
- <code>Dependencies</code>, <code>RelatedIDs</code> → edges (<code>DEPENDS_ON</code>, <code>RELATED_TO</code>)
- <code>Section</code>, <code>Theme</code> → tags (<code>BELONGS_TO</code>)
- <code>Priority</code>, <code>Status</code>, <code>Version</code> → node properties

When imported to Neo4j or a triple store, you can instantly query:

***“Show all high-priority functional requirements provided by managers that depend on Data Upload.”***

#### Optional Supporting CSVs

You can maintain companion reference files:

1. <code>sme_metadata.csv</code> – SME names, roles, departments, contact, expertise domain.
2. <code>sections_lookup.csv</code> – canonical system sections (for consistency).
3. <code>themes_lookup.csv</code> – predefined requirement categories.

These ensure clean joins and controlled vocabularies when building your knowledge graph.

## Question
Is there a way to anonymise respondents?

### Response

When eliciting requirements from *internal* subject-matter experts (SMEs), anonymisation helps reduce bias and social 
friction (especially in hierarchical environments), while still letting you correlate input patterns for quality and 
traceability.

Let’s go deep — below I’ll explain **strategic design options**, and then show **practical implementation steps**
(including updates to your pipeline and GitHub Action).

#### 1. Design Principles for Anonymisation

| Objective                           | Design Implication                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protect privacy                     | Remove direct identifiers (names, email, job titles).                                                  |
| Retain analytical value             | Keep pseudonyms or hashed IDs for tracking patterns.                                                   |
| Preserve traceability internally    | Maintain a secure mapping file stored outside the public repo (e.g., internal vault or GitHub Secret). |
| Reversible only under authorization | Hashes with a secret salt allow re-identification if necessary, but not by the public.                 |

---

#### 2. Practical Options

**Option A. Pseudonymization**

Replace each SME’s name with a stable pseudonym like <code>SME001</code>, <code>SME002</code>, etc.

**Pros**: Reversible with a lookup table; useful for follow-up interviews.
**Cons**: Slight admin overhead maintaining the mapping file.

**Implementation:**

- Create a file secure/sme_mapping.csv (not tracked in Git).
- Script uses it to assign consistent pseudonyms.

| SMEName    | Pseudonym |
|------------|-----------|
| Jane Doe   | SME001    |
| John Smith | SME002    |

Then replace <code>SMEName</code> in the merged dataset with <code>Pseudonym</code>.

---

**Option B. Hashed IDs (irreversible anonymisation)**

Hash each SME’s name using a salted hash (SHA256 + secret salt).

**Pros**: Fully anonymised; easy to automate; no mapping storage needed.
**Cons**: Can’t reverse it — no follow-up interviews via this ID.

Example hash:

<code>hash("Jane Doe" + secret_salt) → "f2d3c59..."</code>
