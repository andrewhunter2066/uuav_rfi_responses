        "MissionAuditAndTraceability",
        "ThreatsAndRiskManagement"
      ],
      "Rationale": "Data artifacts include raw sensor data, bathymetry, environmental models, and mission logs. These are the backbone inputs and outputs across most mission planning domains."

        "EnvironmentalAndOceanographicConditions",
        "DataProductsAndRequirements",
        "StandardsAndGovernance"
      ],
      "Rationale": "Service artifacts (APIs, external connectors, integration pipelines) support ingestion of environmental data, fusion of geospatial formats, and interoperability standards."

        "EstimationAndUncertaintyModeling",
        "IntegrationAndFeedback"
      ],
      "Rationale": "Workflow artifacts model how missions are planned, optimised, executed, and iteratively refined. They link closely to navigation, risk management, and planning objectives."

      "SupportsDomains": [
        "MissionParametersAndObjectives",
        "MissionAuditAndTraceability",
        "StandardsAndGovernance"
      ],
      "Rationale": "UI artifacts (interfaces, provenance displays, LLM interactions) support user suitability, audit traceability, and compliant visualisation of metadata."

        "NavigationAndPositioning",
        "StandardsAndGovernance",

        "ThreatsAndRiskManagement",
        "StandardsAndGovernance",
        "DataProductsAndRequirements"

      "Rationale": "Operational and governance artifacts (cyber worthiness, testing, compliance logs, data retention) underpin safety, accountability, and regulatory assurance."
