A request for information for the development of a mission planning application received the following responses for
Scenario 4 which consisted of the following task-based questions:

Task 1 - Report of current risk profile performance and management systems effectiveness
Task 2 - Analyse vehicular performance profiles during adverse weather, environmental or restricted waterways.
Task 3 - Investigate the quality of sounding operations during mission execution
Task 4 - Capture 'OFFICIAL' level task identifiers and missions plans
Task 5 - Report risk deficiencies or notifiable incidents (i.e. comms, inoperable UUV, etc.)
Task 6 - Are the current standards adequate for format and capacity?

As with Scenarios 1 to 3, Tasks 1 to 3 have been grouped under the heading "Route Option Evaluation"; Tasks 4 and 5
are related to "Risk Evaluation" and Task 6 is related to "Data Records".

 The responses so far are - grouped by Task:

Task 1:
Current systems provide baseline risk profiling but lack dynamic environmental integration.
Risk models should incorporate real-time oceanographic data and UUV performance metrics.
Effectiveness is limited by static thresholds and absence of adaptive learning from past missions
standard operating procedures, security risk assessment used to evaluate, endorse AUV risk
Environmental conditions stipulated in objective quality evidence
original equipment manufacturer software supplies endurance estimation, time on mission
suitably qualified and experienced personnel mission commanders leading operations



Task 2:
Performance degradation in high-current zones, shallow water, and acoustically complex environments should be logged.
UUV stability, propulsion efficiency, and sensor reliability under adverse conditions must be tracked.
Comparative analysis across platforms and mission types is essential for refining operational limits.
Currents are a major influence for mission profiles
Wind, Sea State, Swell for launch and recovery
Vessel traffic considerations for unplanned, GPS surface fixing


Task 3:
Sounding quality is affected by UUV altitude, pitch, roll, and environmental noise.
MBES and Doppler Velocity Log performance should be benchmarked against expected resolution and coverage.
Data gaps and anomalies must be flagged for post-mission review and future planning.
Data is fit for purpose but could be better


Task 4:
Mission plans should include timestamped task identifiers, objectives, and environmental overlays.
Metadata tagging for each mission phase enables traceability and reuse.
Integration with Defence data standards ensures consistency and interoperability.
AO search
AO search
Acquire target


Task 5:
Incident logging should include root cause analysis and operational impact.
Comms dropouts, sensor failures, and navigation drift must be recorded with geospatial context.
Risk flags should trigger automated alerts and post-mission debrief requirements.
Current incompatibility solutions do not exist
Deconfliction of communication channels achieved through liaison and mission orders


Task 6:
Current standards are functional but lack flexibility for emerging data types (e.g., AI-generated insights).
Format should support structured and unstructured data, including imagery and acoustic logs.
Capacity must scale with multi-UUV operations and high-resolution datasets
Currently adequate but can be improved
