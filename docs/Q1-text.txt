A request for information for the development of a mission planning application received the following responses to the
question "Q1 - What test scenarios and supporting data does the system need to provide to support mission planners in
evaluating route options, based on calculable or estimable factors (e.g., time, usage)? The responses:

To improve classification given the RFI responses are jargon dense and specific to marine navigation planning, I have
incorporated a set of domain-specific controlled synonyms:

Given the RFI Q1 responses, are there elements that should be added to the domain synonyms?

Optimal terrain analysis particularly identifying areas exceeding original equipment manufacturer-stipulated avoidance or abort angles.
Current and tidal stream predictions especially East Australian Current influence.
Input speed requirements to achieve mission objectives
Swept-channel survey planning with 200 metre width constraints.
Multibeam Echosounder coverage maps showing resolution overlap and gaps.
Time-on-task estimates based on unmanned underwater vehicle speed swath width and environmental conditions.
Terrain complexity and seabed gradient data to assess survey feasibility
Transit time to beach from launch point.
Terrain and seabed gradient data for approach routes.
