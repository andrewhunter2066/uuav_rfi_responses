AURRP-01,Route Planning,"End-to-end process optimisation for selection of the optimal route(s) from a candidate set, for consideration by the mission commander"
AURRP-02,Sensor Interface,"Demonstrate ability to interface with existing sensors"
AURRP-03,Contribute to the UUV navigation,"The solution should have the ability to contribute to a comprehensive navigational picture within defined mission parameters."
AURRP-04,Ingest Environmental Data,"The solution should take environmental inputs to optimise the efficiency of route planning including: Tide/current speed and direction; Wind speed and direction; Turbidity; Seawater density; Air and seawater temperature; Seawater density and temperature layers"
AURRP-05,Leverage LLMs,"Leverage one or more Large Language Models (LLM) via a user interface.The solution shall present outputs and reasoning to the mission planner via a user interface so that the planner may action an authorisation decision. The solution shall demonstrate user interaction in a flexible multi-stage mission planning paradigm, with capture at every stage of the provenance of decision-making. This provenance will form an integral part of the system, supporting future optimisation processes."
AURRP-06,Route planning software to enhance productivity,"Expect solution to enhance productivity rather than ""replace"" a mission planners work flow."
AURRP-07,User Suitability,"Demonstrate ability for mission planners to use the solution with their existing knowledge."
AURRP-09,Data Fusion,"Fuse heterogeneous data types. Demonstrate the ability to accept and integrate a range of data types as specified in the SOR. The solution must accept the following geospatial data types: Geospatial data (various), Geographic Data (.KML), Hydrographic Data (.XTF), ESRI(?) Geodatabase Data (.GDB), ASCII Data (.XYZ), Image Data (.TIFF, .GeoTIFF, .JPG), Video Data (.MP4)."
AURRP-10,Solution must be standalone,"Solution is not to be connected to Defence ICT systems"
AURRP-11,Read Only,"Ensure data is not unnecessarily duplicated."
AURRP-12,Cyber worthiness,"Ensure system integrity."
AURRP-13,System Flexibility,"Open Architecture development."
AURRP-14,AI Model Specification,"The solution should include documented specification of AI model type, framework used."
AURRP-15,Platform Agnostic Design,"Route planning is not unique to a single platform."
AURRP-16,Route Optimisation,"Routes optimised for specific mission requirements."
AURRP-17,Adaptability to uncertain environments,"Respond to uncertainties in environmental conditions."
AURRP-18,Obstacle Avoidance,"Avoidance of obstacles in the operating environment"
AURRP-19,AI to be self documenting,"The solution must produce documentation with appropriate metrics and AI model type. GenAI for metadata to be self-documenting."
