|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **current, tidal, tide, EAC, east australian current** | `{"time": ["timing"], "duration": ["timeframe", "period"]}`                             | Avoid replacing “current” with temporal sense (“current time”) when it’s oceanographic.   | Disable temporal synonym replacements if any of these terms appear.                      |
| **survey, multibeam echo sounder, mbes, coverage map** | `{"survey": ["assessment", "examination"], "data": ["information"]}`                    | In marine context, “survey” means *data acquisition*, not *evaluation*.                   | Skip synonym expansion for “survey” and “data” if survey-related protected terms appear. |
| **navigation, route, trackline, trajectory, heading**  | `{"path": ["route", "trajectory"], "location": ["position", "coordinates"]}`            | These are already canonical; replacements can blur distinctions between spatial entities. | Treat these as canonical; do not apply path/location synonym mapping.                    |
| **depth, bathymetry, seafloor, seabed**                | `{"area": ["region", "zone"], "water": ["marine", "aquatic"]}`                          | These describe vertical spatial dimensions, not planar “areas.”                           | Skip spatial synonym replacement when depth terms are present.                           |
| **risk, threat, hazard, cyber risk, no-go zone**       | `{"important": ["critical", "essential"], "limitation": ["constraint", "restriction"]}` | Avoid reducing explicit risk terms to general “importance.”                               | Protect risk semantics by disabling generic “importance” synonyms.                       |
| **launch, recovery, transit, endurance**               | `{"mission": ["operation", "task"], "time": ["timing"]}`                                | Operational phases, not abstract missions; risk of losing operational structure.          | Disable mission/time replacements if these appear.                                       |
| **gps, gnss, positioning, navigation**                 | `{"accuracy": ["precision"], "location": ["position", "coordinates"]}`                  | GPS and GNSS already imply accuracy and position.                                         | Suppress those synonym expansions when these acronyms occur.                             |
| **sensor, sonar, acoustic, telemetry**                 | `{"data": ["information"], "collection": ["gathering", "acquisition"]}`                 | Data acquisition hardware shouldn’t trigger text-based sense of “collecting.”             | Disable these expansions when instrumentation terms appear.                              |
| **knowledge graph, ontology, taxonomy, json-ld**       | `{"data": ["information"], "collection": ["gathering", "acquisition"]}`                 | These are structured data entities, not raw collections.                                  | Skip synonym expansion to preserve schema semantics.                                     |
| **launch and recovery system, lars, auv, usv, rov**    | `{"vehicle": ["platform"], "capability": ["ability", "capacity"]}`                      | These denote physical assets, not abstract capabilities.                                  | Keep as-is; suppress replacements on these entities.                                     |
